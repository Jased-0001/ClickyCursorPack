# Clicky Cursor Pack

```python
code(this is real code)

if theCodeIsReal == True:
    print("I can't believe how real this code is")

else:
    print("false advertising ðŸ’€")

def thisCodeIsSoReal(p)
```

## where cursor go???

after you download the zip from the release page, extract it.

open Control Panel, search for "mouse", and click on "Change how the mouse pointer looks".

then, in the "pointers" tab, double click on "Normal Select" and go to where you extracted the zip.

double click "Normal.cur" and repeat for all the cursors.
